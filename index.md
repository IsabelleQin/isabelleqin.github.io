# Qiaolin (Isabelle) Qin

### Hi! You found me! ðŸ‘€âœ¨

#### I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Polytechnique Montreal, supervised by Professor Heng Li and Professor Ettore Merlo. Before joining PolyMTL, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Southeast University. My research interests include data engineering, log analysis, AI fairness, and active learning. Basically I do all sorts of research as long as they are beneficial to the software engineering community:-))

#### I also do bodybuilding because calisthenics is way too hard for me:-(
