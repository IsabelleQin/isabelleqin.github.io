# Qiaolin (Isabelle) Qin

### Hi! You found me! ðŸ‘€âœ¨

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Polytechnique Montreal, supervised by Professor Heng Li and Ettore Merlo. My research interests include data engineering, log analysis, AI fairness, and active learning. Basically I do all sorts of things:-))

I also do bodybuilding because calisthenics is way too hard for me.:-(
