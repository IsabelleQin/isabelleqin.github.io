  aboutMe:
    "I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Polytechnique Montreal, supervised by Professor Heng Li and Professor Ettore Merlo. Before joining PolyMTL, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Southeast University. My research interests include log analysis, AI fairness, and AI explainability. Basically I do all sorts of research as long as they are beneficial to the software engineering community:-))",
